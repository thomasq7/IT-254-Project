# IT-254-Project

Introduction
An ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an object using sound waves. The sensor emits high-frequency sound waves and listens for the
echo. By calculating the time it takes for the echo to return, the sensor can determine how far away the object is. This project
demonstrates how to use the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino to measure distance and display the results.


Project Parts required
1. 1 x Arduino Board
2. 1 x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
3. 1 x Breadboard
4. Jumper Wires
5. 1 x Active Buzzer 5V (HXD)


Steps:
Connect the VCC pin of the HC-SR04 to the 5V pin on your Arduino.
Connect the GND pin of the HC-SR04 to the GND pin on your Arduino.
Connect the Trig pin to Pin 9 on the Arduino.
Connect the Echo pin to Pin 10 on the Arduino.
