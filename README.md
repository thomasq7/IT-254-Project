# IT-254-Project

Introduction

This project controls an 8x8 LED matrix using an Arduino and the MAX7219 LED driver. It allows displaying custom patterns, animations, and text.


Project Parts required
1. 1 x Arduino Board
2. 1 x 8x8 Led Matrix Board
3. 5 Jumper Wires


Steps:
1. Connect the VCC pin of the LED to the 3.3V pin on your Arduino.
2. Connect the GND pin of the LED to the GND pin on your Arduino.
3. Connect the DIN pin to Pin 11 on the Arduino.
4. Connect the CS pin to Pin 10 on the Arduino.
5. Connect the CLK pin to Pin 13 on the Arduino

Install LedControl Library (The LedControl library is needed to control the MAX7219:)

1. Open Arduino IDE.

2. Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries...

3. Search for LedControl by Eberhard Fahle.

4. Click Install.
